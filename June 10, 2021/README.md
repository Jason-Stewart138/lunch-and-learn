Today we're taking a step back to go over some basic termonoligy. Code examples will be available which relate to each definition.

### Datatypes
* Number
* String
* Boolean

### Variable
a variable is a value assigned to a key. In a typed language, the variable is initialized as a specific type.

### Function / Procedure
A function is a group of statements that perform a task. Functions can take parameters as input.

Functions can be used to reuse code segments and allows complex functions to be split up into smaller, simpler functions.



### Parameter
A parameter is a functions input value or values. 

### Loop

A loop is a way to iterate over a list of items.

### if/else
<pre>if</pre> statements are conditional statements which branch into different segments depending on the result.

### switch case
swithc statements are similar to if/else statements, 


### Meaningful comments



### Front End
### Back End
### API
### Error Handling
Try/Catch
